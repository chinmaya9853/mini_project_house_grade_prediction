🏠 House Grade Prediction Project 📈

Welcome to our House Grade Prediction project! Our objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the grades or ratings of houses based on various features and attributes.

🔍 Key Objectives:
1️⃣ Data Analysis: Explore and analyze the dataset of house listings, identifying important features that contribute to the grading.
2️⃣ Feature Engineering: Process and transform the raw data, extracting meaningful features and creating new variables if necessary.
3️⃣ Model Development: Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to accurately predict house grades.
4️⃣ Model Evaluation and Refinement: Assess the model's performance, fine-tune parameters, and optimize its accuracy.

💡 Why it matters:
Accurate house grade prediction can benefit real estate professionals, homeowners, and potential buyers. It helps in making informed decisions related to property investment, estimating property values, and understanding the factors that impact house ratings.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies:
We will utilize popular Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning, such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Feature selection techniques, regression algorithms, and model evaluation metrics will be employed.

📊 Expected Outputs:
Our project aims to develop a reliable predictive model that can estimate house grades based on a set of input features. We will present model evaluation metrics, visualizations, and insights gained from the analysis of important features contributing to the house grading.
